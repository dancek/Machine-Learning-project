\section*{Abstract}

Classification algorithms have each their own characteristics, which
have both strengths and weaknesses. By combining different classifiers,
inherent weaknesses of a single classifier can be overcome. We propose
an ensemble method for classifying binary data, combining predictions of
three different classifiers. The Support Vector Machine, Bernoulli
Mixture and Random Forest classifiers are used, each outputting
prediction values in the continuous range $[0,1]$. These predictions are
combined by the arithmetic mean.

A data set of 10000 e-mail messages divided into classes \emph{spam} and
\emph{ham} was used for testing the ensemble method. The validation
accuracy of the ensemble classifier was significantly better than the
best individual classifier, while the test accuracy was only very
slightly better. The test accuracy achieved by the ensemble classifier
was $98.0 \%$.
